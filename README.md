> - 站点名字: 史莱姆的博客
> - 站点编写: 史莱姆[前端]
> - 站点类型: 响应式、H5、ES6、不兼容低版本IE、服务端渲染
> - 开发时间: 2018-12-17 16:37
> - 技术难点：前后端分离、VUE全家桶应用、服务端渲染、单页应用、SSR、NUXTJS、SEO、加载速度优化、数据安全及服务器安全处理
----------

### 前端:
 + CSS3
	 + less
 + HTML5
 + JavaScript ES6
 + VUE
    + vue-cil
    + vue-router
    + vuex
    + vue-resource
    + axios
 + NUXT

### 环境: 
 + ContOs 7 64x [`ngnix v1.14.2`]

### 备注:
 + 前端环境采用ngnix原因：适合静态，效率高，占用资源少，反向代理，异步，轻量 `（个人按目前情况 依次排列的权重）`

> 站点规范:
> - 前端代码/页面【采用腾讯工程师规范】
> - 所有内部图片【采用腾讯压缩上传】
> - 兼容移动端分辨率范围 [`200px~1920px`]
> - 大部分控件为响应式
> - 语义化标签，合理css书写，降低耦合度
> - ES6写法，控件尽量使用面向对象

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
